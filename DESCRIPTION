Description: A package for fast and robust calculation of Pesaran's CD test. It substitutes
  for pcdtest in plm package in two situations:
  1) when the panel is huges (since it is faster than pcdtest in plm package) and
  2) when the panel is highly unbalanced (since is calculates CD test even when
  some observations do not have overlap in their time dimension).
